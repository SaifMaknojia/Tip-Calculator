### Built with
-Flexbox
-Sass-css
-Mobile-first workflow
-Create-React-App
-React-hooks.
-Media queries for responsive layout


### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


### What I learned
- its important to plan rather then just start implementing project.
- breaking down the component into small pieces is always gonna help build project faster.
- I started project in single page, later i converted the code into small components.
- Keeping code resuablity was the most important thing in mind.
- How to style radio buttons to look like normal buttons.
- Conditionally render content based on userinput.
- Basic form validation like if user input doesn't match required input.
- The biggest problem i faced was improper styling, as i didnt plan the project beforehand.


## Things i will start implementing in next project
- plan the project 
  -- where will state leave
  -- break the project into components folder,utils folder(code that is gonna be resused), style folder(css), pages folder.
  -- Breakdown the file according to components eg:
  src
    -components
      --table
        --Tableheader
        --TableBody
      --Header
        --Logo
        --Navbar
        --button
      --Footer
        --Logo
        --Content
    -utils
      --logo
      --form
    -pages
      HomePage
      FormPage
      

## Best Practice Learned 
- If working in team always use PropTypes for props. 
- use comments so that team can understand where the problem is when debugging an error.
- focus on reusabilty, as its cleaner and easy to identify bugs we might encounter.
- understand the design and break in folders i.e what other components will it take eg:   
      --Header
        --Logo
        --NavbarList
        --button(sign in/sign Out)
- keep a track on time, as it will help us understand how to much time we need to finish the project.
